## ‚ö° Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the game running quickly:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.
2.  **Clone/Download:** Get the project files onto your machine.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Game:** From the same terminal location, execute:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```
    The game window should appear.

**To view your game statistics:**

**Horror Light** is a survival horror game developed using Python and the Pygame library. Navigate dark and eerie environments


## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

* **Root Directory** (`Horror_Light/`)
    * `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python libraries for the project.
    * `README.md`: This documentation file.

* **Assets** (`assets/`)
    * Contains all graphical and audio assets for the game.
    * `BG/`: Stores background images for different levels.
    * `character/`: Contains sprite images for the player character.
    * `enemies/`: Holds sprite images for game enemies.
    * `items/`: Includes sprites for collectible items like gems and keys.
    * `obstacles/`: Contains sprites for static game obstacles (e.g., walls).
    * `roundfont.ttf`: Custom font file used in the game UI.
    * `loading.gif`: An animated image used for visual effects.

* **Data & Statistics** (`data/`)
    * Handles game data persistence and statistical analysis.
    * `game_data.csv`: A CSV file where detailed gameplay statistics are logged.
    * `stats/`: A directory where graphs generated from `game_data.csv` are saved.
    * `game_manager.py`: Manages the overall game state, tracks score and statistics, and handles saving data to `game_data.csv`.
    * `graph_generator.py`: A script dedicated to reading `game_data.csv` and generating visual statistical reports (graphs).

* **Game Core Modules**
    * Contains the fundamental logic and components of the game.
    * `game.py`: Implements the main game loop, manages levels, renders the game world, and orchestrates interactions between components.
    * `player.py`: Defines the player character's behavior, movement, interactions (flashlight, items), and collision handling.
    * `map.py`: Contains data structures and logic for defining the layout, entities, and geometry of different game levels.
    * `settings.py`: A configuration file containing global constants such as screen dimensions, speeds, colors, and time limits.
    * `sprites.py`: Defines Python classes for all different types of game objects (sprites) like obstacles, enemies, items, etc., inheriting from `pygame.sprite.Sprite`.
